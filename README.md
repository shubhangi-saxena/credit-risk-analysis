Credit scorecards are basically used to assess the creditworthiness of customers. there are different factors that are possibly correlated with the customerâ€™s chances of defaulting such as salary age, marital status, etc., and attributes of the loan contract such as term, APR rate, etc. Build a classification model (using techniques like Logistic Regression, LDA, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Boosting, Bagging) to classify good and bad customers (default and non-default customers) and use the model to score new customers in the future and lend to customers that have a minimum score. Credit scorecards are heavily used in the industry for taking decisions on granting credit, monitoring portfolios, calculating expected loss, etc.
